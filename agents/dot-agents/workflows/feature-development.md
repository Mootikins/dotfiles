# Feature Development Workflow

> Step-by-step process for developing new features in Crucible

This document outlines the complete workflow for developing new features, from planning to deployment.

## Phase 1: Planning & Analysis

### 1.1 Requirements Gathering
- [ ] Understand the feature requirements
- [ ] Identify user stories and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Determine technical constraints and dependencies
- [ ] Estimate development effort and timeline

### 1.2 Technical Analysis
- [ ] Analyze existing codebase for similar patterns
- [ ] Identify affected components and modules
- [ ] Plan data flow and state management
- [ ] Consider performance implications
- [ ] Review security and privacy requirements

### 1.3 Architecture Design
- [ ] Design the feature architecture
- [ ] Define API interfaces and data structures
- [ ] Plan integration points with existing systems
- [ ] Consider extensibility and plugin integration
- [ ] Document design decisions

## Phase 2: Implementation

### 2.1 Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement core business logic (Rust)
- [ ] Add necessary data structures and types
- [ ] Implement error handling and validation
- [ ] Add comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Follow established coding conventions

### 2.2 Backend Integration
- [ ] Add Tauri commands for desktop integration

- [ ] Implement user interactions
- [ ] Add responsive design considerations

### 2.4 Integration & Testing
- [ ] Integrate frontend with backend
- [ ] Test data flow and state synchronization
- [ ] Verify error handling and edge cases
- [ ] Test user workflows end-to-end
- [ ] Performance testing and optimization

## Phase 3: Testing & Quality Assurance

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- [ ] Write unit tests for all new functions
- [ ] Test error conditions and edge cases
- [ ] Verify input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Test async operations and timeouts
- [ ] Achieve >80% code coverage

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- [ ] Test component interactions
- [ ] Verify API integration
- [ ] Test database operations
- [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Verify plugin integration if applicable

### 3.3 User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Test user workflows and scenarios
- [ ] Verify accessibility requirements
- [ ] Test performance under load
- [ ] Validate user experience
- [ ] Test error recovery and edge cases

## Phase 4: Documentation & Deployment

### 4.1 Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add user guides and tutorials
- [ ] Update architecture documentation
- [ ] Create migration guides if needed
- [ ] Document configuration options

### 4.2 Code Review & Refactoring
- [ ] Conduct thorough code review
- [ ] Refactor based on feedback
- [ ] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Improve error messages and logging
- [ ] Clean up temporary code and comments

### 4.3 Deployment Preparation
- [ ] Update version numbers
- [ ] Update changelog and release notes
- [ ] Test build and packaging
- [ ] Verify installation and upgrade paths
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Includes appropriate comments and documentation
- [ ] Passes all linting and formatting checks

### Performance
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource issues
- [ ] Efficient algorithms and data structures
- [ ] Minimal impact on startup time
- [ ] Responsive user interface
- [ ] Optimized for expected data volumes

### Security
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization
- [ ] Secure data handling and storage
- [ ] No sensitive data in logs or errors
- [ ] Proper permission checks
- [ ] Follows security best practices

### Usability
- [ ] Intuitive user interface
- [ ] Clear error messages and feedback
- [ ] Accessible to users with disabilities
- [ ] Consistent with existing UI patterns
- [ ] Works across different screen sizes

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Technical Issues
- **Incomplete error handling**: Always handle all possible error conditions
- **Memory leaks**: Properly clean up resources and subscriptions
- **Race conditions**: Be careful with async operations and state updates
- **Type safety**: Use proper TypeScript types and Rust type annotations
- **Performance**: Avoid unnecessary re-renders and computations

### Process Issues
- **Skipping tests**: Always write tests before or alongside implementation
- **Insufficient documentation**: Document complex logic and public APIs
- **Premature optimization**: Focus on correctness first, then performance
- **Scope creep**: Stick to the defined requirements and acceptance criteria
- **Inadequate review**: Get feedback from other developers

### Integration Issues
- **Breaking changes**: Consider backward compatibility
- **State management**: Ensure consistent state across components
- **Data synchronization**: Handle conflicts and edge cases
- **Plugin compatibility**: Test with existing plugins
- **Cross-platform**: Test on all supported platforms
